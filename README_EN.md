### Random Walk
This script simulates random walks in 2D, 3D, and 4D space and visualizes the trajectories both statically and as animations. The project demonstrates properties of stochastic motion and differences between spatial dimensions. The program generates multiple independent trajectories, computes their evolution, and saves animations as video files.
### What it includes:
- Random walk simulation in 2D
- Random walk simulation in 3D
- Random walk simulation in 4D (3D projection + color as the 4th dimension)
- Static visualizations of multiple trajectories
-Time-based motion animations
- Automatic saving of animations to .mp4 files
- Trajectory coloring by index or dimension value
### Parameters
- steps = 1000 — number of walk steps
- walks = 20 — number of trajectories
- interval = 50 — animation interval (ms)
### Visualizations
- 2D: static plot of multiple trajectories; animated 2D random walk; start and end points marked.
- 3D: static trajectory plot in space; animated 3D random walk.
- 4D: random walk in four dimensions; projection to 3D space; color represents the fourth dimension (W); single-trajectory animation; static plot of 20 trajectories.
